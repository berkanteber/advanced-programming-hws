I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss. I see the lives for which I 1ay down my 1ife, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy. I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.
